# ml-house-pricing
This project aims to predict house prices using various regression techniques on the Kaggle House Prices dataset. We implement and evaluate models such as Decision Tree, LASSO, and KNN, focusing on feature engineering, data preprocessing, and model performance.

## Dataset
The dataset for this project comes from [Kaggle's House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques competition](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/housing-prices-dataset/data). It contains features such as the size of the house, neighborhood, year built, and more, with the target variable being the sale price.

## Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing.
- Integration of multiple regression models for price prediction.
- Evaluation of models based on RÂ² and MSE.
- Feature engineering including handling null values, data concatenation, and introducing a TimeIndex feature.

## Installation and Execution
Clone the repository and install the required Python packages:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GilMacDev/ml-house-pricing.git
cd ml-house-pricing
pip install -r requirements.txt
python .\ml-house-pricing.py
```
